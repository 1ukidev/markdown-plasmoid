# Markdown-plasmoid

This is a simple plasmoid that loads an markdown file and displays it.
The file is loaded and converted to html with [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it). This way you can inject your own css bevor diplaying the file.

If you click on the text an editor with the file loaded is opened.

You can hide the note so nobody behind you can read it :)

In the settings can be changed:
- the file location
- the editor
- you can specify some custom css
